Airplane Class

Airodynamics - 3:06:39
	wings
		upper camber - top 
		upper camber - top
		lower camber - bottom
		chord - direct line running from leading edge to trailing edge
		leading edge - front
		trailing edge - back

		angle of attack - degrees from chord line to direction of the wing
		critical angle of attack - 
		critical angle of attack -
		parasite drag - drag not associated with production of lift
			form drag - wheels, antennas, rivets, etc
			interference drag - intersection of airstreams causing eddys/turbulence
			skin friction drag - contact of moving air
		induced drag - 
		induced drag -
		wingtip vortices - spiraling air off the ends of wings
		wake turbulance - large aircraft's wingtip vortices can last several minutes
			avoid follwing another aircraft at an altitude within 1000 feet
			rotate prior to the point at which the proceeding aircraft rotated
			land after the preceding aircraft touchdown
			(maneuver above and upwind from the preceding aircraft)
		Ground effect
	stalls
		critical angle of attack
		low speed - lower the airspeed becomes the more the angle of attack must be increased
		high speed - angle of attack changes abruptly from quite low to very high (example: pulling out of a dive)
		turning - centrifugal force is added to the aircraft's weight
